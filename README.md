# SpilledMilk.com

The source for the http://SpilledMilk.com website.  There really aren't any "trade secrets" in here so I figure I'd make this public.
Everything that's in the code is effectively being rendered on the client anyway.
I took a lot of the default settings from the ASP.Net MVC project and haven't had the time to clean it out.  All in good time I guess.
